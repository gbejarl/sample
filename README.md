# Hazard Modeling Code Collection

This repository contains example codes showcasing different tools and methods I use in my research on volcanic hazards. It is organized into two main folders:

## LaharML
A machine learning-based lahar detection system developed solely by myself. This project focuses on classifying lahar events using seismic data and includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Model training and evaluation pipelines
- Real-time detection script examples
- Tools for performance visualization and interpretability

This folder highlights my skills in signal processing, machine learning, and real-time hazard detection systems. All code is fully written and maintained by me.

## VolcFlow
An implementation of the **VolcFlow** numerical model, originally developed by Karim Kelfoun (Universit√© Clermont Auvergne) for simulating granular and multiphase flows; appropriate credit to the original developer is provided within the folder. This folder includes my adaptations to use VolcFlow for modeling **pyroclastic flows**:
- Setup scripts for customized boundary conditions
- Example input files for pyroclastic flow scenarios
- Post-processing tools for model outputs
- Notes and modifications to the original model for specific case studies

This section reflects my ability to adapt and modify existing numerical codes to address specific research questions in volcanic hazard assessment.
