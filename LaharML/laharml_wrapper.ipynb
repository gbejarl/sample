    "When you run the code below, the `run_detection` function processes the seismic data file specified in `stream_filepath` using the LaharML classifier. It applies the selected detection model (`model_label`) and uses the provided parameters to filter and analyze the signal. The models are stored in the \"Models\" folder. The function identifies potential lahar events based on the seismic patterns, only reporting events that exceed the minimum duration set by `minimum_duration_to_alert`. The output will summarize detected events, helping you assess flood and debris flow activity at the chosen station and channel.\n",

    "The output includes a .csv file whose name starts with the `detections` prefix and a figure with three panes. In the upper pane, you will find the raw waveform for the file you selected. In the middle pane, you will find the raw classifications based on the K-nearest neighbor algorithm. In the lower pane, you will find the post-processed detections the include a routine for noise reduction and interval delineation. Those intervals explain the start and end time of the lahar event and are saved in the .csv output file."
