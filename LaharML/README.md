# LaharML

Welcome to the LaharML project! This repository provides tools and scripts for machine learning workflows.

## Getting Started

To begin, please use the `laharml_wrapper.ipynb` notebook. It contains step-by-step instructions and examples for running the main functionalities of LaharML.

## Python Files Overview

- `extract_from_directory_general_model.py`: Reads stream data and generates lahar and debris flow detections based on the input model.
- `laharml.py`: Main library of functions used by the detector to prepare, classify and post-process detections.
- `XX.XXXX.XX.XXX_modelscaler.py`: Generates the KNN-based classification model based on available training and testing data.

Refer to the notebook for guidance on how to use these modules together.
